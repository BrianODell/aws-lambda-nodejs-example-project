# AWS Lambda Example Project

# Introduction

This is an example **[AWS Lambda] [aws-lambda]** application for processing a **[Kinesis] [aws-kinesis]** stream of events. It reads the stream of Thrift-serialized events generated by our own **[Kinesis Example Scala Producer] [kinesis-example-producer]**, and sends an email via **[SendGrid] [sendgrid]** if a toy scenario is met.

If you have not done so already, you must **[apply to join] [lambda-preview]** the AWS Lambda preview.

## Building

Assuming git, **[Vagrant] [vagrant-install]** and **[VirtualBox] [virtualbox-install]** installed:

```bash
 host$ git clone https://github.com/snowplow/aws-lambda-example-project.git
 host$ cd aws-lambda-example-project
 host$ vagrant up && vagrant ssh
guest$ cd /vagrant
guest$ npm install
guest$ grunt xxx
```
